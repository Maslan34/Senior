### Project Advisor [Burhan Sel√ßuk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/burhan-sel%C3%A7uk-0a610a23/)




## Overview

This project involves the development of a mobile academic application using the Flutter framework. The application is designed to streamline the evaluation process of students' graduation projects. The system includes three main roles: Admin, Jury, and Students.

- **Admin**: Admins add jury members to the system and send them their credentials via email.
- **Jury**: Jury members add students to the system, who are then notified via email. Jury members are responsible for evaluating the projects.
- **Students**: Students upload their thesis documents (PDF) and presentation videos to the system for evaluation.

Once the jury members complete their evaluations, the scores are made available to the students.
